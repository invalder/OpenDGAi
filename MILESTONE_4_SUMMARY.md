**Why:** Prevents breaking changes, ensures data reliability, builds trust  
**Success Metric:** >95% breaking changes prevented, quality scores correlate with user ratings (r>0.8)

**Example Use Cases:**
- Dataset quality score drops from 85 to 60 → auto-alert to data steward
- Schema change detected → all downstream consumers notified before deployment
- Git-like diff shows exactly what changed between v1.2 and v1.3

### 4. UX Enhancements (2 weeks)
**What:** Command palette (Ctrl+K), dark mode, WCAG AAA, Progressive Web App  
**Why:** Power users are 50% faster, accessibility compliance, mobile-first experience  
**Success Metric:** 50%+ power user adoption, WCAG AAA verified, 500+ PWA installs
